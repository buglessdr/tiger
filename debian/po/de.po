#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"You should customize the files at /etc/tiger/ to adapt to your local "

"in this system, as well as the information needed for tests in order to "
"reduce false positives (in /etc/tiger/tigerrc). Secondly, customizing at "
"what times these tests will be executed (in /etc/tiger/cronrc). And thirdly, "
"since some modules warnings might not be problems regarding your current "
"security policy, define a given template file at /etc/tiger/templates/ using "
"runs from each of the modules. Once defined, all the runs will be checked "
"against each one of the templates available (one per module) and only new "
"warnings will be issued."

"Initially Debian's 3.1 tiger versions were distributed with a bug that would "
"cause templates to be created under /var/log/ instead of /var/log/tiger/. "
"Normal operation assumes templates are under /var/log/tiger/ and these "
"templates will not be useful in newer Tiger versions. You might want to "
"preserve a copy of them (to use as templates) and move them manually under "
"their proper location. The package will not do this automatically in order "
"to avoid removing previous templates. Should we remove these files if any "
"are found?"
