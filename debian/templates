Template: tiger/mail_rcpt
Type: string
Default: root
_Description: Who should receive the daily mails?
 The user you enter below will receive all the emails that 'tiger' sends
 during the day when running the cron jobs. This does not mean that when
 executing the 'tiger' program standalone this user will receive the
 reports. Also note that any administrator will be able to access the
 reports since they are available in the /var/log/tiger/ directory.

Template: tiger/policy_adapt
Type: note
_Description: Take a minute to customize 'tiger'
 You should customize the files at /etc/tiger/ to adapt to your local
 security policy. Firstly, customizing the kind of checks that will be made
 in this system, as well as the information needed for tests in order to
 reduce false positives (in /etc/tiger/tigerrc). Secondly, customizing at
 what times these tests will be executed (in /etc/tiger/cronrc). And
 thirdly, since some modules warnings might not be problems regarding your
 current security policy, define a given template file at
 /etc/tiger/templates/ using runs from each of the modules. Once defined,
 all the runs will be checked against each one of the templates available
 (one per module) and only new warnings will be issued.
