.TH TIGERCRON 8 "19 September 2003" "Security" "Administrator Commands"
.SH NAME
tigercron \- Cron utility for Tiger UNIX Security Checker 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "tigercron [-B basedir] [..tigeroptions..] [controlfile] "
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Tigercron is used to run periodically checks from the Tiger
UNIX Security Checker. \fBTigercron\fR reads a control file
which is located in '@tigerconfigdir@/cronrc'. The format
of this control file is the same as for the \fBcron\fR program, each
line indicates when different checks from \fBTiger\fR will be run.

\fBTigercron\fR runs the specified checks and compares their reports 
with previous stored reports (under @tigerlogdir@). It will then
mail the user defined in the '@tigerconfigdir@/cronrc' 
(\fITiger_Mail_RCPT\fR) the results.

When a module is run, \fBtigercron\fR checks:

.PP
* If \fITiger_Cron_Template\fR is set to Y in tigerrc. If it is, it checks
if there is a template stating which are the expected results.
.PP
* If \fITiger_Cron_CheckPrev\fR is set to Y in tigerrc. If it is, it checks
if there is a previous run of the module it can check against.

A differential report is generated depending on the module reports
and previous run and is sent through e-mail. These reports
provides an easy way to detect intrusions even if no configuration
of templates has been done. In the event of an intrusion a \fBTiger\fR
check might detect something specific (file changes, new processes,
new users, etc.) and this alert mechanism provides a way to turn
\fBTiger\fR into a Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS).

The hability of it to work as a proper HIDS is based on a good customization
of the cronrc file. Modules that check events to which the host is
most exposed to should be run often in order to detect deviations
from normal behaviour.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBTigercron\fR uses the same options as \fBTiger\fR. A controlfile
can be defined also to override the default.

The deficiencies of using \fBtigercron\fR as a HID are described in the
file README.hostids which is provided with the package. In Debian
GNU/Linux you will find this (and other related) documentation at
/usr/share/doc/tiger/
.SH BUGS
Currently \fBTigercron\fR has only one alert mechanism (mail) and signatures
are not supported. Thus, alerts could be faked. Also, it is dependant
on \fBcron\fR and will not work if its not working.
