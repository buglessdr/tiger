'tiger' is a set of scripts that scan a Un*x system looking for
security problems, in the same fashion as Dan Farmer's COPS.  'tiger'
was originally developed to provide a check of UNIX systems on the A&M
campus that want to be accessed from off campus (clearance through the
packet filter).  As such, we needed something that *anyone* could run
if they could figure out how to get it down to their machine.

If you just want to run it, without regards to time considerations,
then just 'cd' into the tiger directory and run './tiger' as 'root'.

--->  You should check to see if you have the latest digital signatures
      for the system(s) you are checking.  I regularly place updated
      signature files on anonymous FTP at

      net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/tiger-sigs/*

      The util/installsigs script can be used to install the updated
      signatures.  As of Tiger 2.2.2, installsigs is also capable
      of installing signatures for new OS releases (not new platforms
      or major releases though).

*NOTE*

The 'tigerrc' file is set up for TAMU hosts, and disables/reduces some
of the checks.  You should probably copy 'tigerrc-dist' to 'tigerrc'
and edit it to taste.  It is set for a fuller check mode (TAMU hosts
might want to run with this config file as well).  'tigerrc-all' has
everything already maxed out and enabled (except for PATH_ALL).

(Or use the '-c' switch to use an alternate tigerrc file as of 2.2.2)

I recommend that you read the USING file for anything other than the
aforementioned situation.

See the file COPYING for legal stuff.

If you have any thing to say about 'tiger', please let us know.  New
things to check, how to improve things, *anything*, send it in... if
you think someone else has already sent in a bug report, suggestion,
etc., send it in anyway... the more times someone hits me over the
head with something, the more likely it is to get fix/included...
